Project Goal:

The goal for this project is to become familiarized with full-stack web development. This project will be made on the python Django framework with the goal of
developing an organized and efficient back-end program that can be displayed and interacted with by the user. 

Project Vision / Scope:

The idea for this project is to build a Recipe web app that returns and displays food recipes based on the users fitness goals. It will also feature a Caloric
and Macro diary where the user can enter their daily nurtitional intake to track their consistency. This is somewhat similar to the Myfitness App with some slight
changes. I plan on building this apps back-end completley on Python whilst the front-end will be developed with HTML, CSS and Javascript. By the end of the 
project the user should be able to :

- Enter physical body measurements and fitness goals
- Have a customized list of recipes that fit within their fitness goals and nutritional needs
- Access the recipe instructions/ingredients/equipment for the recipe of their liking
- Log and track their daily caloric and macro nutrient intake in a Fitness Diary
- Filter recommended meals by meal type
